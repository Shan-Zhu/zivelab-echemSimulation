Digital Simulation for Electrochemical Experiments

Some electrochemical experiments on simple E mechanism were simulated by using Excel and VBA.
* Reactions: A + ne <-> B
* Experiments: Cyclic Voltammetry, Chronoamperometry, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy

This is based on Prof. M. Rudolphâ€™s early publications, on the Fast Implicit Finite Difference (FIFD) method. D. Britz's book  and A. J. Bard and L. R. Faulkner's textbook were also referred to.
